# FilebeatToCloud

An easy way to add a Filebeat configuration to your system


## Used Filebeat version

This app currently runs with the 8.3.1 version of Filebeat --> https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/filebeat-8-3-1


## Ideas

Make a upper level menu to choose to add a new Filebeat configuration or to use an existing/ancient one

Being able to export / import a gonfiguration --> generated/parserscript.js + generated/headersConfigs/config_..js + filebeat.yml

Being able to have multiple Filebeat instances/services + create a management panel


### Disclaimer

I don't to modify any file / folder content or name or the app could stop working
