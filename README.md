# FilebeatToCloud

An easy way to add a Filebeat configuration to your system


## Used Filebeat version

This app currently runs with the 8.3.1 version of Filebeat --> https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/filebeat-8-3-1


## Ideas

Make a upper level menu to choose to add a new Filebeat configuration or to use an existing/ancient one

Being able to export / import a gonfiguration --> generated/parserscript.js + generated/headersConfigs/config_..js + filebeat.yml

Being able to have multiple Filebeat instances/services + create a management panel



## Menu preview :

:warning: For now, you can only use the 1st Menu option, as the other ones are ready for deployment yet


## New Filebeat configuration :

:information_source: This page makes you prepare the filebeat.yml file. There are some base field values that you can modify at your ease.

(more info here : https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-reference-yml.html)

### General usage

:information_source: There is a local '.env' file in the 'FilebeatToCloud\py-scripts\' folder in which you can adress your personal information.

  For now, you need to create it youself and write the following properties :
  
  ````
  HOSTS=<kiban url>
  USRNAME=<username(usually 'elastic')>
  PASSWORD=<password>
  ````
  
  With it, you won't have to rewrite the same infos everytime.
  
:information_source: You can add multiple logs input folders paths.

:information_source: If the index doesn't exist in you Cloud instance, it will be automatically created.

:information_source: You can edit the file extension and the attribute separator accrding tou your logs format.

:information_source: Copy/Paste a sample of your logs to identify it's headers and/or how many attributes you need to distinguish in your logs.

Then, press the validation button.

:information_source: Now you can see and modify the attribute names that have been generated by your sample (will be empty if no sample provided)
 
### Disclaimer

I don't to modify any file / folder content or name or the app could stop working
